    "# Classes in python\n",
    "Classes in python allow you to create objects. These objects are nothing more than a collection of data (or variables), and methods (functions) that act on these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot has been written about classes, the best way of explaining how classes work and why they are useful is with a simple example. Therefore, we are going to create a class called **Vector** that will allow you to create vectors (x, y), add two vectors, subtract them, define the dot product between two vectors, multiply a vector by a constant, and obtain the magnitude of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ones that wants to see how the class looks like, the following block of code contains  the class **Vector**. It is important to mention that we are importing **math** because we have to calculate the root square of numbers."
