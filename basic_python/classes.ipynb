    "# Classes in python\n",

    "While a lot has been written about classes, the best way of explaining how classes work and why they are useful is with a simple example. Therefore, we are going to create a class called **Vector** that will allow you to create vectors (x, y), add two vectors, subtract them, define the dot product between two vectors, multiply a vector by a constant, and obtain the magnitude of the vector.\n",
