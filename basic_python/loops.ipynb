    "This notebook contains the basic concepts behind loops. \n",

    "A loop is simple a piece of code that repeats until certain condition is met. There are several ways of creating a loop, we will start with the **for** loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loop\n",
    "You can use a **for** loop to go over each element of a list performing an action. Let’s start with the simplest case, you have a list and you want to print each element of this list. The following block of code shows how to do it:"

    "The first thing to notice is that we are using the word ```number``` in the creation of the loop (the line that says ```for number in my_list:```). However, we could have use any other word and it would have worked in the same way (we would have to change the name of the variable in the print statement inside the loop). Try it!\n",
